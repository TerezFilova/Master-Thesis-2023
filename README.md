# Master-Thesis-2023
This repository was created for the purpose of online storage of the R-code I reffered to in my Master Thesis, which topic was Mathematical modeling of yield curve dependence using copula functions. In the R folder one can find two functions used in the research. More information provided in the comment at the beginning of each R file.

<b> Note: </b> Installation using devtools R package is not possible at the moment.
